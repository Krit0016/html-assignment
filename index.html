        <h2>About Me.</h2>
        <p>Hello, My name is Orranis Krittayaruangkit. You can call me by my nickname Maisie. I am from Thailand. 
            Graduate with a bachelor's degree in business administration majoring in MICE (Meeting Incentive Convention Exhibition and Event) Management. Decide to change my career path to Media Design and now studying at Algonquin college.
        </p>
        <p>In Thailand, I have two dogs: one is a golden retriever named Angpao and the other is a French bulldog named Meetang. I enjoy watching movies and television shows. One of my all-time favorite films is John Carter. In my spare time, I enjoy going for walks to explore, admire, and photograph. Green is my favorite color because it represents freshness, nature, and motivation.
        </p>
